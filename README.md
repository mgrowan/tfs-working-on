# TFS Working On

TFS Working On is a simple time tracker system tray utility that makes it easier to record your time spent working on TFS Work Items. This enables accurate data capture that can be used for schedule reporting and time sheeting. 

Immediately after installing, TFS Working On is ready to help you track your time. Simply specify your server and project, then search for your Work Item and you are tracking your time. 

Time will be recorded in the history of the work item whenever you stop working on the item. You can also specify your estimates against a work item so that you can record how you are going. With some very simple configuration the estimates can be mapped to the TFS Work Item fields, per work item type, per project. This can be performed by one member of the team, most likely the one responsible for setting up the project, and then stored on the network share for all team members to reference. Estimates automatically update the work item fields, making it easier to record time spent and time remaining to help with TFS reporting and evidence based scheduling.
